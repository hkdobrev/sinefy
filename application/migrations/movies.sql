He discovers that his latest financial stunt has landed him in hot water with the government and with his firm''s management, necessitating a return to London. Before leaving, to assist the sale, Max hurriedly snaps photos and falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, whose bicycle he ran off the road with his careless driving, turns on the water supply in retaliation. The resulting delay causes Max to miss his flight. Because he fails to report in person to management, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.</p>', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, 84900, 104362172933708),
